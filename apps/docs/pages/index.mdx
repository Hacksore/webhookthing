# Getting Started

In a fullstack or backend repo, run:

```bash
npx webhookthing@latest
```

If your project doesn't have a `.thing/hooks` directory, a "download samples" button will be available to download some common defaults

![download samples](./img/download-samples.png)

This will create the `.thing/hooks` directory and add a set of example webhooks as .json files.

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  We recommend committing these files to your repo so that they can be shared
  with your team.
</Callout>

Once you have some json files in the `.thing/hooks` directory, you can run them against your local environment by pressing the "play" button

### Adding new webhooks

1. Open the `.thing/hooks` directory
2. Make a new `.json` file
3. Fill the `.json` file with the contents you want to have POSTed when you run the webhook

Your hook should now appear in the UI

### Authentication headers

For certain requests, you may want to include a secret in the headers of the request, but you don't want to commit that secret to your repo. For example, you may want to include a secret in the `Authorization` header of a request to a third-party API.

In this case you can use the `%%ENV_VAR_NAME%%` syntax to include environment variables in your webhook, which will be replaced with the value of the environment variable when the webhook is run.
